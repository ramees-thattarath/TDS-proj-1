# How I scrapped the data
Created an access token in Github dashboard and then collected user details using user search and user detail API. The repository details of these users where fetched using list repository API. The collected data was converted to Pandas Dataframe and then cleaned to meet specifications and then exported as csv

# My Observations on Data
Among the repositories that have high stars and watchers, Typescript seems to lead by a huge margin. Among top 10 starred repositories 7 of them are from TS/JS.


# Actionable recommendation for developers
Having good repository that helps people learn, can attract more followers. The other way to attract more followers would be a good project that is useful or looks attractive.
If we are to build a useful project to gain more followers prefer to have a frontend for the app.
